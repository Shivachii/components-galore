#COMPONENTS GALORE

---

Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

This is my my rendition of 75 hard but with code.
Join me on my creatuve and innovative journey to showcase 75 reusable UI components (navbars, hero sections, footers and more)

---

Each dayâ€™s component is viewable via its own page in this monorepo.

ðŸ“œ Challenge Rules

1. Build 1 new component every day for 75 days.

2. Components are responsive and reusable.

3. No copying â€” everything is coded from scratch.

---

âœ… Goal: Sharpen my front-end skills while creating a library of useful, production-ready UI pieces.
